# Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver PCB for Laser Animations

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a **dual H-bridge circuit** to control two motors. The motors manipulate the position of a laser beam, allowing the creation of animations on a screen. The PCB was designed, soldered, and thoroughly tested to ensure precise and reliable operation.

## Features
- **Dual H-Bridge Circuit**: Controls two motors independently for precise laser beam positioning.
- **PCB Design**: Created using KiCad, ensuring a compact and functional layout.
- **Testing and Debugging**: The PCB was soldered and extensively debugged using an oscilloscope and multimeter to ensure full functionality.
